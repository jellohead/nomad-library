# Nomad Library

Your public library's DVDs, Blu-rays and games on one shelf you can actually browse, with ratings, trailers, filters and a watchlist. Free, no ads.

## Help make it better

- **Something broken, or your library doesn't work?** [Open an issue](https://github.com/Chrisgpresents/nomad-library/issues/new/choose), or use the Feedback button on the site. Problems sent through the site get posted here (without names or emails), so this is one list.
- **Want to fix something?** Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Issues labeled [`good first issue`](https://github.com/Chrisgpresents/nomad-library/labels/good%20first%20issue) are a good place to start, and [`library-request`](https://github.com/Chrisgpresents/nomad-library/labels/library-request) lists the catalog systems people are waiting on.
- **Found a security problem?** Please [report it privately](https://github.com/Chrisgpresents/nomad-library/security/advisories/new), not in a public issue.

The library copier (the part that copies catalogs so shelves open instantly) lives in [nomad-library-data](https://github.com/Chrisgpresents/nomad-library-data). New catalog systems are added there as readers.

## Biggest things we need help with

Counts are people who asked, through the site's Feedback button and the YouTube comments on the launch video.

1. **More library catalog systems (US and Canada).** 48 people are waiting. Each catalog product needs a small reader in [nomad-library-data/readers](https://github.com/Chrisgpresents/nomad-library-data/tree/main/readers) that copies its DVDs, Blu-rays and games into a static file. Evergreen and Koha run whole statewide networks, so one reader can open hundreds of libraries. The hard part: every product shapes its pages differently, some sit behind bot walls this project won't get around, and readers have to stay slow and gentle on library servers. [Library requests by system](https://github.com/Chrisgpresents/nomad-library/labels/library-request)
2. **Libraries outside North America.** 74 people are waiting, in Germany, the UK, France, Denmark, Belgium, Switzerland, Australia and more. Often one platform serves a whole region (Bibliotheca OPEN, bibliotek.dk, Prism), so one reader can open a country. We need people who know which system their library runs and how discs are labeled in their language. Records carry local titles, so matching needs the original title, year or barcode.
3. **Matching each disc to the right film.** Catalogs give the disc's year, edition notes and sometimes a translated title, and the browser has to guess which IMDb title it is. Same-name films (Cosmos 1980 and 2019) get the wrong rating, trailer or cover. Matching runs in the visitor's browser against compact rating files, so better rules (runtime, director, barcode, TV or film) have to stay small and fast. [#16](https://github.com/Chrisgpresents/nomad-library/issues/16)
4. **Cover art for every title.** Some catalogs have no covers (CARL, Spydus), tiny ones, or ones that fail for part of the shelf. A fallback needs a source whose terms allow it, and a reliable film match first. [#4](https://github.com/Chrisgpresents/nomad-library/issues/4) [#18](https://github.com/Chrisgpresents/nomad-library/issues/18)
5. **A directory of libraries that work.** Most people don't know their catalog link and paste the homepage. Working links are already saved per library, so a searchable list by state or ZIP is mostly a data and design job, plus people with local knowledge filling the gaps. [#21](https://github.com/Chrisgpresents/nomad-library/issues/21)
6. **Which branch has the copy.** "On the shelf" can mean a branch 30 minutes away. Each reader would need to keep holdings per branch. [#17](https://github.com/Chrisgpresents/nomad-library/issues/17)

**Bigger ideas (open an issue to talk first):** books, music CDs and audiobooks are the most requested addition (36 people), but there's no IMDb for them, so ratings, covers and matching need new sources, and book catalogs are about 10 times the size. Music CDs are a first step (see below): they browse and search, with the artist in place of a rating.

## Run it on your computer

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Chrisgpresents/nomad-library && cd nomad-library
npm install
npm run data          # downloads the ratings files from the live site (about 1,260 small files)
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars
npm run db            # creates a local database
npm run dev           # http://localhost:8788
npm test              # needs Google Chrome; the network is mocked
```

## How it works

- Hosting: Cloudflare Pages. pages.dev forwards to the custom domain from a script in the page. Functions only run on /api/* and /t (public/_routes.json), so static files never count against the request limit.

- `functions/api/search.js` relays the library's public gateway (no key). Shelves are subject/tag queries that work at every library.
- Ratings: `tools/build_index.py` turns IMDb's free datasets into `public/ix/*.json` shards; the browser matches them (Workers Free allows only 10 ms CPU, so matching never runs on the server). The disc year is a ceiling, most-voted wins, subtitles must match.
- Accounts: passkeys + a backup code (`functions/api/auth/[action].js`), D1 `nomad-library`, signed cookie sessions. No email. Secret AUTH_SECRET (locally from `.dev.vars`).
- Trailers: `/t?q=` finds the top YouTube result on first tap and caches it 120 days.
- Deploy (maintainer only): `tools/deploy.sh` publishes a clean export of `main`. Retry on upload timeouts.
- Passkeys are tied to the domain. Move to the custom domain BEFORE launch, or pages.dev passkeys stop working there (backup codes still work).

## Music CDs (since 11.8.26)
- A Music button next to Both / Blu-ray / DVD / Games, at BiblioCommons libraries only. The copies hold films and games, so CDs always come from the library's own catalog through `/api/search?fmt=music` (`f_FORMAT=MUSIC_CD`). No copy means no Music button at the nationwide shelf, at All my libraries, or at catalogs we copy ourselves (Vega, Polaris...), because none of those can be searched live.
- No ratings: there is no IMDb for albums, so a CD never goes through the rating files. The card shows the artist (`briefInfo.authors`, read as "Last, First") and the year, and Top rated and the film-year sorts are hidden.
- A genre is one subject heading at the catalog (`MUSIC_SHELVES` in `functions/api/search.js`), one at a time, picked in Filters. The headings were checked against real catalogs; "Classical music" is missing at most libraries, so classical sits under Orchestral, Opera and Piano.
- A typed search is a keyword search, which the gateway also matches against the performer, so artist names work.

## Library copies (since 10.11.26)
- A library opens from a static file `snap/<slug>.json.gz` on Cloudflare Pages (https://nomad-library-copies.pages.dev/snap/, project nomad-library-copies; GitHub Pages capped at 1 GB), made by the copier in the `nomad-library-data` repo on GitHub Actions. No Worker serves catalog data. The browser keeps its own copy in IndexedDB (6 libraries, used at once whatever its age, refreshed in the background).
- A library with no copy browses live (`/api/search`). The first visitor's browser sends one `POST /api/want` (once per device per day); the copier reads `GET /api/want` and copies requested libraries, oldest request first.
- `functions/api/snap.js` is the OLD path. The `nomad-library-crawler` Worker was deleted and the D1 `chunks` data cleared on 10.11.26 (SQL backups in ~/nomad-library-backups/). Rollback: deploy tag `pre-static-copies`; every library then browses live, because the old copies are gone.
- Tests: `node test/browser.mjs` (real Chrome, whole network mocked; set FIXTURE_DIR to a folder of catalog files for the large-catalog runs). The copier has its own: `node test/e2e.mjs` in nomad-library-data.
- Limits checked against official docs 10.11.26: Workers Free 100,000 requests/day and 10 ms CPU per request; static files are free and unlimited; GitHub Pages 1 GB site, 100 GB/month soft bandwidth, 10 builds/hour soft.

## Any other catalog (since 10.11.26 night)
- `public/catalog.js` (used by the page and by `functions/api/library.js`) reads a catalog link, names its system (Aspen, Vega, Encore, Polaris, SirsiDynix Enterprise, Evergreen, Koha, Sierra, CARL, Spydus, Apollo, Atriuum) and builds a title-search link. A catalog it doesn't know still works if the pasted link is a search (its `q=`/`searchterm=` value becomes the title).
- A non-BiblioCommons library opens the nationwide shelf (`lib=shelf`, `public/shelf.json`), and "Check at <library>" opens that catalog's search in the visitor's own browser, so catalogs that block programs still work. Never a web search.
- A library website (not the catalog) is read for its catalog. If nothing is found, the page asks for the catalog link; "Skip" still opens movies.
- Catalog links given for libraries in the directory are stored in D1 `catalogs` and served by `/api/catalogs`, so the next visitor from that library goes straight to movies. Hand-added ones: `public/catalogs.json` ("Name|ST": link).

## Other catalog systems we copy ourselves (since 11.1.26)
- Vega (*.iiivega.com, and libraries' own domains that run Vega), Polaris PowerPAC, SirsiDynix Enterprise and CARL / LS2 PAC are copied by readers in `nomad-library-data/readers/<system>.mjs`. Library ids are `<system>.<host>[_<scope>]` (e.g. `vega.sdpl.na5.iiivega.com`, `polaris.catalog.slcolibrary.org_1-1033-0-0-1`); BiblioCommons slugs never have a dot, which is how everything tells them apart (`isReaderLib`, `readerId` in `public/catalog.js`, mirrored from each reader's `libFromUrl`).
- Paste flow: a readable catalog with a copy opens like any library (hold buttons link to the record at the library; no live shelf check, so the copy's shelf status stands and reader copies refresh every 2 days). Without a copy yet: `POST /api/want {lib, name, url}` (D1 `libs.url` keeps the link the copier needs), the visitor browses the popular shelf with Check at, and the page switches to the library's own shelf by itself once the copy exists (`upgradeGuest`). A catalog the copier gives up on (bot wall) stops promising (`guest.noCopy`).
- Custom-domain Vega (catalog.dclibrary.org): `/api/library` asks the site's `/lookup` + `config.js` for the real `<code>.<region>.iiivega.com`.
- Genres: these catalogs rarely carry genre headings, so the copier adds IMDb's genres to every matched title (`public/ix/genres.json`, `tools/build_genres.py`).
- Not readable (measured 11.1.26): Aspen Discovery (Cloudflare blocks or an Anubis proof-of-work wall on every host tried), Great River's Enterprise (Cloudflare challenge).

## License and name

The code is free software under the [GNU AGPL v3](LICENSE): you can use it, change it and run your own copy, and if you run a changed copy as a public website you have to share your changes under the same license. The Nomad Library name and logo aren't covered by that license, see [BRAND.md](BRAND.md). Ratings come from IMDb's datasets (personal and non-commercial use), which is why those files aren't in this repo.
